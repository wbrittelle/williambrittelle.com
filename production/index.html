      <h3>PRODUCTION APPROACH + PROCESS</h3>

      <p>Although computers are useful to sketch ideas and edit material, my production approach is rooted in the
        physical world. I believe that getting the right people in the right room with the right equipment equals the
        best vibe, the most compelling performances, and generates the most exciting ideas. I primarily work out of
        figureight recordings, a two-floor bespoke studio in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn owned by Shahzad Ismaily. Over
        the last few decades, Shahzad has curated an incredible array of vintage equipment, including two wonderful
        boards, an amazing selection of guitars and synths, and loads of priceless, hand-selected outboard gear. My work
        at figureight and with New Amsterdam Records has helped me develop an extensive rolodex of wonderful musicians
        that can swing by for a couple hours (or days) to help fill out recording projects.</p>

      <p>Making records isn't cheap, but I think one cost that's often overlooked is the time of the lead artist. I've
        found that often 1-2 days in the studio yields better results than weeks of hopelessly futzing around with
        plug-ins in Ableton. I regularly work with the figueright house engineer Michael Hammond, a gentle giant with
        phenomenal mixing skills. Often we'll track and pre-mix in the studio, print all the outboard gear, and then
        he'll continue tweaking the "long mix" from his home studio which helps reduce cost and maximize our studio
        time. We've also done work studio mixing projects that were largely recorded off site or at home. For artists
        who prefer more of a "retreat" format, I've worked often with the Grammy-winning magician Zach Hanson (Bon Iver,
        yMusic, the Staves, S. Carey) at the HIVE, a beautiful and extremely quaint studio in a field in Eau Claire,
        Wisconsin filled with fossils, old books, great synths, hand-picked snacks and amazing vibes. </p>

      <p>Should it prove useful, I also have extensive experience with arranging (more info on that <a
          href="../info/">here</a>)
        and am happy to employ those skills in service of the artist's vision. And a note on that . . . when I hear
        about creative control struggles between artists and producers/mixers it baffles me. In my mind, the lead
        artist(s) holds the spiritual keys to the album inside them - there may be better or worse ways to execute
        ideas, but, ultimately, the final say is ALWAYS with the artist. It couldn't possibly be otherwise.</p>

      <p>Lastly, I think there are some records that I can serve better than others. I'm drawn towards projects that
        have a spirit of adventurousness and openness (even if they are fully scored). Many of the records I've worked
        on feature classically-trained artists, but I'm extremely interested in continuing to work with artists from all
        practices including hip-hop, experimental pop, and various traditional musical practices from around the world.
      </p>

      <p>Although I am co-founder/artistic director of New Amsterdam, I've produced albums for a number of different
        labels, including Merge, 37do3d/Secretly Canadian, and Nonesuch. Ultimately, part of my job is to figure out how
        to help projects reach the finish line and find the right home. I find the best way to start the whole process
        is with an open-ended conversation, so feel free to drop me a line if you'd like to talk...</p>
