        Feature in <em><a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/the-genre-of-post-genre/">The Nation</a></em>: "Over
        the past decade, Brittelle has been drawing from his varied experiences in
        classical music, punk rock, and electronica to produce silo-bombing music that is at once free-ranging, formally
        adventurous, unconventionally beautiful, and a joyful thrill to experience."

      <p>"[<em>Television Landscape</em>] evokes an earthquake-weather mood along a painterly musical landscape of
        searing rock,
        shaded by tonal passages of strings and French horns, flutes and, in one emotional spot, a children's choir. You
        might wonder if Jane's Addiction had discovered the soul of Debussy." - <em>The Los Angeles Times</em></p>

      <p>"…the music was substantial: a riotous shotgun wedding of rich orchestrations and complex arrangements with the
        rock-oriented pleasures of flamboyant posturing and excessive volume. Where the two sides came closest together
        the results were irresistible." - <em><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/01/arts/music/01isla.html">The New
            York Times</a></em></p>
      <p>"William Brittelle is creating a body of work that has no precedent, and marks him as a one of the most
        promising heirs of the vital American maverick tradition." - <em>Classical TV</em> </p>
      <p>"This is a fast, fun, freedom-fuelled flurry of a record… William Brittelle is clearly the Dan Deacon of
        contemporary classical." - <em>MUSO</em></p>
      <p>"Amid the Minotaurs", by composer and New Amsterdam co-founder William Brittelle, begins as an ersatz jazz
        madrigal and ends with a gloriously ludicrous, Lita Ford-style power ballad finale. As a composer, Brittelle is
        heroically unafraid of flirting and occasionally consummating the relationship with bad taste, and "Amid The
        Minotaurs", like his 2010 AOR prog-rock suite Television Landscape, has the nervy throwdown feel of an aesthetic
        dare. - <em>Pitchfork</em></p>
      <p>"The Color of Rain" from Television Landscape featured in <em><a
            href="http://www.believermag.com/issues/201107/">The Believer</a></em> Magazine's annual music issue.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>"Brittelle traverses electronica, prog rock, neo-classical, avant-garde, alt rock, and more on Television
        Landscape. But anyone can — and these days, often does — make a record stacked high with eclectic influences;
        the real masterstroke here is the way Brittelle makes all these elements flow together as though they'd always
        been part of the same musical universe, and he achieves a surprising degree of easiness on the ear with this
        deceptively dense, conceptually complex piece of work.” - <em><a

      <p>"<em>Television Landscape</em> is all the things one expects from an epic art-rock album: expansive, anthemic,
        all-encompassing, shot through with raw emotion." - eMusic (from a Spotlight Interview by Jayson Greene)</p>
      <p>"Brittelle channels Prince's heavenly wail, addresses a love song to Sheena Easton and stumbles across
        teenagers smoking American Spirits and singing The Smiths "Girlfriend in a Coma". Melodic, tight, and powerful,
        Brittelle's art rock hanidly outperforms the real thing." - <em>Relix Magazine</em></p>
      <p>"William Brittelle's Television Landscape album could be said to draw on as many music channels as a
        satellite-radio subscription offers. And he seems to integrate them all into one seamless, artfully constructed
        epic.” - <em><a

            Jersey Star Ledger</a></em> (feature interview)</p>
      <p>"(Four star review) The cohesive 50-minute album plays like a glorious reclamation of lush sounds that crusty
        critics have vilified for years…Like the finest AM gold, Television Landscape soothes even as it dazzles.” -

      </p>
      <p>"…larger than life and spectacular in scope. A synthesis of modern classical invention and avant-garde
        experimentation, Television Landscape taps Zappa, mid-period King Crimson and composer Gustav Holst as obvious
        influences. Despite its complexity, it also boasts moments of subtle intimacy…" - <em><a

      <p>"The star of the show was <em>Amid the Minotaurs</em> by William Brittelle, the most daring and also cohesive
        piece of
        the evening, showing the singers to be extraordinarily skilled with huge ranges and sweet, clear voices, the
        climax coming with contralto Virginia Warnken suddenly became a pop diva soprano, pinning the audience to their
        amazed seats.” - The Times Union"Brittelle's crafty, catchy music taps ino the best of what Frank Zappa's oeuvre
        has to offer, while his surrealist lyrics suggest a copy of Roget's Thesarus, the complete Allen Ginsberg, and a
        Taco Bell menu fed into Cuisinart. Factor in Brittelle's charisma, and the results are completely electrifying.”

        "…this song cycle is unhinged from genre, from conventional narrative, and even from conventional singing… The
        music doesn't just combine elements
        of rock and classical — it flits from one to the other with often neck-snapping speed." — WNYC's

      </p>
      <p>"…the orchestra seemed to hit its stride with Bill Brittelle's <em>Obituary Birthday: A Requiem for Kurt
          Cobain</em>.
        Kurt was only really a ghost in that song, but I eventually forgot I was listening for Nirvana because the music
        was so damn beautiful.” - <em>Seattle Met</em></p>
      <p>"William Brittelle's "Obituary Birthday: A Requiem for Kurt Cobain" was a kaleidoscopic drama of protean
        themes, some epic, some small, floating or urgent. Fragmented melodies and a restless brilliance captured
        something of Cobain's artistry and, perhaps, Brittelle's take on the man himself." - <em><a
